## Build vs Buy — Overview

When advising customers on digital transformation, the central question is: **should we build a custom solution or buy an off‑the‑shelf product?**  
The tradeoff is between *customization and control* (build) and *speed and proven capability* (buy).

---

## Build (Custom Solution)
- **Pros**
    - *Tailored fit*: matches exact business requirements and workflows.
    - **Control** over data, architecture, and tech choices.
    - **Differentiation** potential — enables unique features and innovation.
- **Cons**
    - **Longer delivery** and higher initial effort.
    - Ongoing operational burden: *source control, testing, bug fixes, deployments, support*.
    - Requires sustained investment in people and processes.

## Buy (Off‑the‑Shelf Product)
- **Pros**
    - **Fast time to value** — try and deploy quickly.
    - **Proven capabilities** and vendor-provided maintenance.
    - Lower initial project risk for commodity capabilities.
- **Cons**
    - May be **rigid** as requirements evolve.
    - Risk of **vendor lock‑in**, constrained customization, and potential compliance gaps.
    - Might not fully align with unique business processes.

---

## Key Considerations
- **Strategic importance** — Is this capability core to your business or a commodity?
- **Cost vs. value** — Evaluate *total cost of ownership* (licensing, maintenance, custom work).
- **Time to market** — Do you need immediate results or can you wait for a bespoke solution?
- **Long‑term flexibility** — How much control over data and architecture do you need?
- **Risk factors** — Project delays, vendor dependency, compliance, security, operational burden.
- **Organizational capacity** — Do you have the people, skills, and processes to build and operate a custom system?

---

## Hybrid Approach
Most organizations adopt a **hybrid** strategy: *build the differentiating, strategic components* and *buy commoditized parts*. This balances cost, speed, functionality, and agility.
