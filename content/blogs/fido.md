FIDO (Fast Identity Online) revolutionizes authentication by employing strong cryptographic principles, eliminating the need for passwords. Its functionality revolves around three primary components: authenticators, clients, and servers.

### Components in FIDO Authentication
#### Authenticators
These are the devices responsible for user authentication. Authenticators can be hardware-based (like USB security keys) or built into devices (biometric sensors or TPMs). They securely store user credentials and generate cryptographic keys used in the authentication process.

#### Clients
The client represents the user's device or browser where authentication occurs. It interacts with the authenticator and the server during the authentication process. Web browsers, native mobile apps, or desktop applications can act as FIDO clients.

#### Servers
Servers manage user authentication. They interact with the client and the authenticator to verify user identities. The server validates authentication requests, confirming the user's identity without receiving sensitive information like passwords.

### FIDO Authentication Flow
#### FIDO2 and WebAuthn
##### Registration

<img src="/images/blogs/fido/fido-registration.png" alt="Fido registration process explained" class="responsive-image">
The client generates a new key pair and requests the authenticator to create credentials for the user.
The authenticator creates the credentials and returns a public key to the client.

The client sends the public key and additional registration data to the server.
The server verifies the data and registers the user, associating the public key with the user's account.

##### Authentication
When authentication is required, the client requests authentication from the authenticator.
The authenticator verifies the user's identity using stored credentials and generates an authentication assertion.
The client sends the authentication assertion to the server.
The server validates the assertion using the stored public key associated with the user's account.
