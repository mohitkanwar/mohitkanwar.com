After my first job switch, I landed up in Sapient Nitro. This was my first experience in a services organization. While not drastically different from Infosys culture. 

The nature of the project was that a American Banking customer had purchased a product "Backbase", and we had to customize the product as per the bank's needs and requirements.

The learnings that I got from this project were drastically different from my first project - Finacle.

1. User Experience is most important aspect
1. Develop APIs that support the frontend (Backend for Frontend layer)
1. Have slow build times, but fastest execution times. Prepare ahead.
1. Have different databases for read and write operations
1. Be flexible and don't stick to a technology
1. Be vocal. Share your learnings with your team mates.
