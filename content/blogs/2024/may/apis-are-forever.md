# APIs, like diamonds are forever.
APIs are expensive to build and maintain, and once developed they have little resale value. 

As an architect, we have to give full attention to the APIs being developed. In one of the assignment, I observed four to five versions of the same API all running parallally, because there is no single version that caters to all the requirements.

The existing spagatti code doesn't allow it to be fixed within the given time frame, and the default accepted way of working has become to add a new version of the API whenever a slight change is required in the API.

This has resulted in increased complexity in adding new features or debugging a given problem.

The problem is visible across layers. multiple versions of db tables create confusion in which data is populated where.
Half of the data is present in one table, the other half in another table.

On the cost of speeding up now, we are eating up time from future.
