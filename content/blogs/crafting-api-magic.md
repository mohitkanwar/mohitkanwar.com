## Unveiling the Elegance of API Design
In the intricate world of software architecture, API design emerges as a symphony, a composition that can either elevate a system to greatness or introduce complexities that echo through time. Joshua Bloch's insights, shared in the iconic talk '[How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAb7hSCtvGw&t=8s),' in the year 2007, still serves as guiding principles for architects and developers seeking to sculpt APIs that stand the test of time.


## Mastering the art of designing APIs

Application Programming Interface (API) is a mechanism using which the programming world interacts with your application. APIs are the instructions that clients send to the system in order to get some work done.
The APIs can be invoked via the same module, or within the system, or infact the public APIs are exposed to the world to interact with. The larger the audinece of the API, the more difficult it is to change them at a later stage. And hence it becomes very important to get the APIs right in the first attempt. And this is indeed a very difficult task.

Architects and developers alike play the role of API design. 

APIs stand as the foundational pillars of software mastery. Their design can either propel a system toward excellence or introduce complexities that resonate throughout its lifecycle.

Public APIs, much like diamonds, endure. Crafted with precision, they shape the software landscape for years, making it imperative to consider their longevity during the design phase. A system's quality is determined by the quality of it's public APIs.

## The Good API

API is a tool for programmers to develop systems on top of the APIs. Some characteristics of a good API are
- Memorable
- Easy to use
- Difficult to misuse
- Built for users
- Enforcing better design 


A good API should be easy to understand and remember. Even without reading the documentation, the API should reflect exactly what it is doing. 

A good API should be simple to use, and difficult to misuse.

An API is also like a blog, it should be designed according to the audience. i.e. the people with the context of the domain should be able to easily use the API.

In the orchestration of APIs, simplicity emerges as the guiding light. Designs should be intuitive yet robust, enabling seamless integration for developers with minimal cognitive load.

## Process of developing a good API

- Understand requirements
- Understand the real need of the customers (whys)
- Start with small spec
- Discuss and update the spec with multiple stakeholders
- Create simple early APIs to test and experiment
- Start implementing it early to get early feedback
- Document right, provide good examples on usage


## Service Providers Interface (SPI)
SPI stands for *Service Provider Interface*. It is a design pattern used in software development to enable the extension or replacement of components within a system without modifying its core. 

The SPI pattern defines a set of interfaces, and the actual implementations of these interfaces are provided by service providers. 

This allows for a flexible and modular architecture where different implementations of a service can be plugged in without affecting the rest of the system.
Joshua refers to [The rules of three](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/211782.211785) as specified by Will Tracz, and explains if we want to create a reusable API, we must try out atleast three implementations of it. When we create at least three different implementations, it helps in designing our APIs (SPI in this case) robust and strong enough to be resued in multiple other scenarios that we might not have thought of.

## Maintain realistic Expectations
In the dynamic landscape of API development, it's crucial to approach the process with pragmatic expectations. Here are key principles to guide your mindset:

Most APIs Are Over-Constrained; Limit Them:

It's common for APIs to be burdened with unnecessary constraints, often stemming from an attempt to foresee every possible use case. However, this can lead to unnecessary complexity. Instead, focus on essential features and avoid over-constraining the API. Keep it streamlined and aligned with the core purpose.
You Cannot Make Everyone Happy, and You Don't Have To:

Recognize that it's impossible to cater to every individual preference or requirement. APIs serve diverse users with varied needs, and attempting to please everyone can result in an overly complex and compromised design. Instead, prioritize clarity, simplicity, and meeting the primary use cases.
Expect to Make Mistakes; APIs Evolve Over Time:

Embrace the iterative nature of API development. Mistakes and oversights are inevitable, but they present valuable learning opportunities. APIs are not static entities; they evolve based on feedback, changing requirements, and emerging technologies. Expecting and embracing evolution allows for continuous improvement and resilience in the face of evolving demands.
Maintaining realistic expectations fosters adaptability and resilience in the API development journey. By acknowledging constraints, accepting diverse user needs, and embracing the evolution of APIs, developers set the stage for sustainable and effective API architectures.


## APIs should do one thing, and do it well
Going back to the 'S' of SOLID principles, one APIs should be taking up a single responsibility. An API that does only one thing, can make the usage easier, and by chosing the correct name for the API, the users can know exactly what the API delivers.

## Define standards (and follow them)
API for a larger system are developed by a team of software architects and developers. People come from different background and expertese. Defining standards to be followed in a system allows the system to meet a certain level of quality.

Having standards clearly understood by the team reduces the time in understanding the requirements and development of the APIs


## When in doubt - Leave it out
The most important point that Joshua wants to highlight is that an API can be modified later to add more functionality. But once a functionality is added to an API, it cannot be removed. So if you have a slight doubt if a functionality is fit in the API, most probably it is not. So leave it out. If at a later stage you believe that the functionality is important, the API can be evolved easily. 

When can adding a functionality in an API is harmful? Whenever we add a functionality in an API it is available for all the clients of the API. It means, the functionality is enforced upon the users. We must evaluate thoroughly if adding a  functionality can negatively impact any of the users of the API. We should not break the defined functionalities in order to honor an optional or good to have feature.

## Exceptions
All APIs are subject to some exceptional behaviour. The exceptional scenarios of the APIs should be well defined, but must not leak the implementation details to the clients.

## Names do matter
In the intricate dance of API design, the names chosen for functions, classes, and methods play a pivotal role. They serve as the interface's expressive vocabulary, communicating intentions, and functionality to developers. Well-thought-out names make the API self-explanatory, reducing the cognitive load for users and making the code more readable and maintainable.

Choosing appropriate and intuitive names is not just a matter of semantics; it's an art that influences how developers interact with the API. A carefully crafted name encapsulates the essence of the functionality, contributing to the overall elegance and usability of the API. In the symphony of code, the right names orchestrate a harmonious experience for developers.
## Documentation Matter
Documentation is the lantern that illuminates the path for developers navigating the landscape of an API. Beyond mere comments or descriptions, comprehensive and well-structured documentation is a beacon that guides users through the intricacies of the interface. It goes beyond the 'what' and delves into the 'how' and 'why,' providing insights, examples, and best practices.

A robust API deserves documentation that acts as a companion, easing the learning curve and empowering developers to make the most of its capabilities. Well-documented APIs are more likely to be adopted seamlessly, fostering a positive developer experience. In the collaborative symphony of coding, documentation stands as a key score, ensuring that every participant can contribute harmoniously to the performance.

## Consider performance consequences of API design decisions
Efficient API design goes beyond functionality; it extends to performance considerations. Neglecting the performance impacts of design decisions can lead to suboptimal system behavior. Here's why and how to ensure your API design is performance-conscious:

Performance Impacts by Surrounding Systems:
Recognize that an API operates within an ecosystem, and its design can influence the performance of surrounding systems. Consider factors like the impact on memory usage, CPU load, and interactions with the garbage collector. Strive for a design that not only meets functional requirements but also minimizes adverse effects on the overall system performance.
## Fail Fast
In the realm of API development, the principle of failing fast emerges as a crucial strategy. Failing fast involves identifying errors or issues as early as possible in the development process. Here's why and how to embrace this principle:

Early Validation and User Notification:

Incorporate robust validation mechanisms into your API. Detect issues, such as incorrect inputs or violations of constraints, at the earliest stage possible, preferably during compile time. By doing so, developers receive prompt feedback about potential problems, enabling faster debugging and resolution.
Debugging Efficiency:

Failing fast enhances the efficiency of the debugging process. When errors are detected early, developers can pinpoint the root causes more rapidly. This proactive approach reduces the time and effort spent on troubleshooting, contributing to a more streamlined development workflow.
Compile-Time Validation:

Leverage compile-time validation to catch errors before runtime. This approach shifts error identification to an earlier stage in the development lifecycle, reducing the likelihood of issues reaching production. Compile-time validation promotes code correctness and enhances the overall reliability of the API.
