      <title>Software Engineering Skills</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of my friends come to me and ask about the skills required to grow in the software engineering field. The primary intention behind their questions is usually to understand which latest technologies they need to learn. Should they focus on improving their Python or Java skills? Should they focus on Frontend, Backend or DevOps?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While learning specific technologies or languages is certainly important, I believe that it constitutes only a small portion of what it takes to become a good software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sequence Diagrams using Mermaid</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been creating designs for software solutions for quite some time now. A picture is worth a thousand words and hence the different diagrams really help in expressing the software designs in a better way to fellow team mates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Sequence diagram is a powerful tool that shows the step-by-step interactions between different parts of a software system, making it easier to understand how messages and actions flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve utilized various tools like Visio and Draw.io for manual diagram creation. However, in recent times, I&amp;rsquo;ve found mermaid.js to be my preferred tool for crafting sequence diagrams. Mermaid.js stands out as it enables diagram creation using a specific DSL, primarily in markdown format. This markdown is swiftly transformed into shareable diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dev Experience</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.blog/2024-01-24-how-githubs-developer-experience-team-improved-innerloop-development/&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on the GitHub blog that discusses how GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Developer Experience (DX) team improved innerloop development.&#xA;While reading the article I was reminded of this quote&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clients do not come first. Employees come first. If you take care of your employees, they will take care of the clients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;â€” &lt;cite&gt;Richard Branson&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And as a leader of a development team, I was made to think what am I doing for better experience of my developers, and what can be done better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
