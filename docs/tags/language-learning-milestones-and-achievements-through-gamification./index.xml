      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-by-gamification&#34;&gt;Learning by Gamification&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have ever taught a child who is just starting school, you may have noticed that concepts that seem simple to you can be quite complex for them. This is due to their limited understanding and lack of prior knowledge. Additionally, children often have short attention spans and can easily be distracted by their surroundings, making it even more challenging to teach them new concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to better understand how to teach these concepts effectively, I reached out to a school teacher named Mrs. Rasika. She graciously invited me to observe one of her classes, and the experience made me nostalgic for my own school days. During this day, I witnessed Mrs. Rasika using creative and engaging methods to teach different subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
