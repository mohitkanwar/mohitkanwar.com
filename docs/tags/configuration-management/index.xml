      <description>&lt;p&gt;Configuration management is a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of working with microservices. In a microservices environment, managing various configurations, including those related to client applications, business processes, and technical settings, can become complex. This complexity is further amplified when dealing with multiple environments such as development, QA, and production, each requiring different configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While organizations typically maintain version control for their codebase, the versioning of configurations is sometimes neglected. In this article, we will explore how we can create a configuration management microservice using Spring Cloud Config, a powerful solution provided by the Spring framework. We will specifically focus on its applicability in the FinTech industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
