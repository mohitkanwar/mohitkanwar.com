      <description>&lt;p&gt;In any software development project, logging plays a vital role in understanding and troubleshooting the behavior of applications. Imagine you are working on a web application that consists of multiple components, such as a frontend server, backend server, and a database. Each of these components generates logs that provide valuable insights into their operations. For example, the frontend server logs can reveal user interactions, while the backend server logs can show the processing of requests and responses. These logs act as a valuable source of information for developers and support teams to diagnose issues, track performance, and monitor the overall health of the system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
