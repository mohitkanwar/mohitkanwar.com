      <description>&lt;p&gt;A microservice is a small, independent application that is designed to perform a specific business functionality. It is a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each running in its own process and communicating with each other through lightweight mechanisms, such as HTTP or messaging protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to learn how to structure an individual microservice application, and break it down into different components. We are going to use SpringBoot as a tool to design the microservice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
